# Threshold Assignment
Welcome to the 2025 Reinforcement Learning coursework focusing on developing an RL agent and environment for exploring a hazardous environment and exploiting maximum rewards in spite of local minima.

## Overview
In this coursework, you will be tasked with implementing a Sarsa or Q-Learning algorithm within a cliff-walk gridworld environment. This repository contains all the necessary starter files and resources.

## Getting Started
To get started with this assignment:
1. Use the provided link to access the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-URL>`.
3. Ensure you have Python installed, and consider setting up a virtual environment for this project (see below)
4. Open `Assignment_empty.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment to begin working on the assignment.

## Assignment Tasks
Complete the navigation tasks as outlined in `Assignment_empty.ipynb`, applying either the Sarsa or Q-Learning algorithms. Your implementation should be submitted according to the submission guidelines provided in your course materials.

## Python Setup Instructions 
Use of one of the following sets of commands to set up a python environment. 
```
virtualenv .com_env
source .com_env/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy 
pip install ipykernel
```

```
conda create -n com_env
conda activate com_env
conda install numpy matplotlib
```
